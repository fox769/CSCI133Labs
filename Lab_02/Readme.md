These are the patterns for the changing growth rate.

g = 2
>
	Year    Population
	1		26
	2		66
	3		141
	4		195
	5		165
	6		189
	7		171
	8		186
	9		174
	10		184
	11		176
	12		183
	13		177
	14		182
	15		178
	16		181
	17		179
	18		180
	19		179
	20		180

When the growth rate is set to 2, this is where the population starts to show noticible oscilation. The population caps out a 195 but goes up and down around 179 and 180 during the last quarter.

At 30% growth rate the population stagnates and doesn't change at all in the following years.

g = 3
	Year    Population
	1		36
	2		123
	3		316
	4		202
	5		359
	6		75
	7		228
	8		346
	9		117
	10		307
	11		224
	12		349
	13		108
	14		293
	15		254
	16		320
	17		191
	18		360
	19		71
	20		219

At 300% growth rate, the populations shows chaotic behavior. Not a clear oscillation between values that atre close like in the 200% growth rate population.
